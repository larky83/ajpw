            <p>Since 1984, Misawa had been wrestling as the second generation Tiger Mask. While Misawa found success under the mask, this success was attributed more to the Tiger Mask character than to the man behind the mask. This would all change here in a moment that has gone down as one of the most pivotal in wrestling history. From the beginning part of the match both Misawa and Kawada are being beaten down and mocked by their opponents. Unable to gain momentum, Misawa demands Kawada remove his mask. The crowd erupts with chants of “Misawa, Misawa, Misawa” as along with his partner Kawada they manage to get back into the fight.</p>

            <p>Can Terry Gordy make history as the first gaijin Triple Crown Champion? With Tsuruta already booked to defend his Championship defence against Misawa in three days time he was the favourite to reatin his championship, but a Terry Gordy DDT at the right moment has the potential to change everything.</p>

            <p>Less than a month after his unmasking, Misawa was already set to challenge Jumbo’s reign as the Ace of AJPW.  Just three days before this match, Jumbo had suffered a shocking loss to Terry Gordy that cost him the Triple Crown Championship. As the action begins you can see that Jumbo isn’t taking this challenge as seriously as some of his previous encounters. He’s almost disrespected by the audacity this young man has to challenge him. But with each passing minute, Jumbo slowly comes to the realisation that he’s in for one hell of a fight. This match would receive a 5 star rating from the Wrestling Observer.</p>

            <p>Terry Gordy’s reign with the Triple Crown would come to an abrupt end after he was forced to vacate the title due to being hospitalised. As the last man to hold the title before Gordy, Hansen was chosen as Misawa’s opponent. To Hansen’s surprise Misawa starts the match my attacking him with his own Western Lariat sending both to the outside. He takes the fight to Hansen with an aggresive game plan leading to Misawa taking a huge risk.</p>

            <p>With Taue's betrayal fresh in Misawa's mind the first singles match between these two would be a memorable one. These men would push each other so hard we would be witness to the birth of the 'Tiger Driver 91'.</p>

            <p>You can feel the bitterness Jumbo still holds towards Misawa over his loss the previous year. However, the real hatred is between Kawada and Taue. Taue debuted in 1988 and would soon form a successful team with Jumbo. The team of Jumbo and Taue would feud with the team of Misawa and Kawada which lead to the intense rivalry between Kawada and Taue. This hotly contested back and forth match full of brutal strikes that doesn’t slow down for a second. After the thirty minute mark the crowd starts to grow into a frenzied state as they come to realise that they could be about to witness a sixty minute draw. By the fifty minute mark all six men are reaching their limit with just one big shot required to finish it. This match would receive a 5 star rating from the Wrestling Observer. </p>

            <p>As this match begins you can sense the urgency in Misawa and Kawada to avenge their previous loss to the Champions. This leads to Misawa throwing huge elbows early but is caught by Gordy with a viscous clothesline. One that would break Misawa’s nose and leave Kawada fending for himself again. With Misawa out of action, Gordy and Williams press the advantage with frequent tags and tandem offence. Kawada shows incredible heart by creating enough of an opening to make the tag. A rested Misawa enters the match on fire but the grizzled veterans target his broken nose.</p>
